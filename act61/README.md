Bootstraps I added/improved:<br>
*form-inline - for the search bar as an experiment for the search bar that can usually be found in the newer instagram.<br>
*Changed the position of the nav-pills, instead of the big words, I added a [+] symbol for "adding new posts" to access modal.<br>
*Updated the navbar, added Instagram text, added several symbols that are present in the newer version of Instagram.<br>
*Wanted to find a font that somewhat matched instagram, tried to get out of my comfort zone by not using png/images of logo, it was interesting importing and trying to match fonts.<br>
*list-groups - used for the bottom area of the card, the Comment Input and the Post.<br>
*Edited the header dropwdown list, added a sticky top feature on it so it would stay on the top.<br>
*Added a btn to make a cursor a pointer for a new icon, and some other icons.<br>
*Edited the col-md for the sizes of the rows' column in the collection content.<br>
<br><br>
Additional Changes:<br>
*font awesome icons - added  more and even different ones.<br>
*ion-icon icons - used this specifically to get the paper plane symbol that looked exactly like the one in instagram.<br>
*fa sizes - Editedn the fa-#x for the sizes of fontawesome icons.<br>
*fa-flip features - on one photo because they looked like they were angled in the opposite direction.<br>
*Changed the width of the cards(home/#prova), as well as the container(#menu2) to 50%.<br>
*Changed the sizes of the columns and the amount of rows, resulting to 2 photos per row.<br>
